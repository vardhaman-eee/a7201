# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

 Electrical Circuits is an integrated course intended to enhance the knowledge of students in electric circuits and develop analytical skills. This course provides basics of network theorems and its application to solve DC and AC circuits. This course provides basics of network theorems and its application to solve DC and AC circuits. This course also introduces self and mutual inductances and series resonance. Students will learn the concepts of two-port networks and network transients.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
